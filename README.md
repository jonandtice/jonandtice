## About Me
I'm just here to see what all the fuss is about. Might contribute to some open source projects. I know a little C from college, a little python from fooling around, and a less C++. My main interest at the moment is the Asciidoc format using asciidoctor with asciidoctor-pdf since it will help me with technical writing at work.
